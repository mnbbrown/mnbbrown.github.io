Exciting news! I've been accepted into the inaugural [Startup Catalyst](http://www.startupcatalyst.com.au/) program!

> Startup Catalyst is an annual mission to Silicon Valley for
> twenty young people who have the potential to be Australiaâ€™s
> next batch of globally successful tech entrepreneurs.

That means I'll be off to the US of A on the 16th of November for 2 weeks visiting companies like [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) and [Google](https://google.com), and dropping in to accelerators like [Plug and Play Tech Center](http://www.plugandplaytechcenter.com/), [500Startups](http://500.co) and [Runway](http://www.runway.is/)!

The highlight of the program will be participating in [Startup Weekend](http://startupweekend.org/): 52 hours to come up with an idea, form a team, validate our assumptions, build a prototype and launch!

I can't wait to start exploring the global center of technology development and business growth with Brisbane's startup elite: Steve Baxter (of Pipe Networks fame), Colin Kinner, Peter Laurie and Jason Seed - as well as 19 other up and coming tech entrepreneurs.
