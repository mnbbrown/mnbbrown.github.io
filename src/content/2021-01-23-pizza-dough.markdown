In an attempt to match a restaurant quality Neopoliatan pizza, I've been experimenting with different pizza dough recipes and toppings. Most the experiments below have been made using an Ooni Koda 12" and use Shipton Mill's 00.

## Jan 23 2021

For 4 pizzas... using the same ratios as last time (before I started documenting). Experimenting with timings from https://github.com/hendricius/pizza-dough.

### Ingredients:

- 530g '00' flour
- 0.3g yeast
- 15g salt
- 330g water (64% hydration)

### Method:

- 20:00: Mix ingredients
- 20:30: stretch and fold
- 21:00: stretch and fold
- 22:00: stretch and fold
- 22:30: stretch and fold, leave out overnight
- 08:00: stretch and fold
- 08:15: divide and shape, to fridge
- 18:00: remove from fridge, reshape
- 19:00: cook

### Toppings

- Margherita
- Cajun beef mince + caramelised onions
- Salami, mozerella, rocket
- Mushroom, Jalepeno, mozerella

### Eating notes

Toppings were great. Bases/dough is still a little "bready". I think this is maybe caused by either a. oven too hot (hence burning without the interior having time to cook) b. hydration or salt content percentage not quite right.

## Feb 1 2021

For 4 pizzas... This time I used the ratios and timings from https://github.com/hendricius/pizza-dough.

Dough was cold-proofed for 48 hours instead of 24 hours. Also, I accidently covered the pre-proofed dough in oil.. this meant the dough tasted better (longer proofing time) but had a weird crisp and colour (because of the oil). So.. 1 step forward.. 1 step backward.

### Toppings

- Margherita
- French salami, mozerrella, rocket
- Prawn, Garlic and Chill
- Mushroom, caramelised onion
