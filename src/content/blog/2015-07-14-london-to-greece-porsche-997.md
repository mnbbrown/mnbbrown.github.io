## The Setup

I've done my fair share of long road trips but when my Greek boss invited me to his "big fat Greek wedding", I had to make something of it.. yet another crazy plan.. could I buy a fun car, and skip the summer airport choas, and see some of the balkans enroute. 

My wife had to work the week before the wedding, so the journey would start solo - we'd reunite in Greece and make the return journey together as a dynamic duo.

## Finding the Perfect Steed

Over a couple of months, I became a little obsessed over the decision. Coupe or cabriolet? 996, 997, or Boxster 981? The internet unanimously voted cabriolet, but being a "ranga" (albeit an Aussie ranga), I knew better than to subject my pale skin to 20 days of European summer sun. 

After test driving two 997s and a Boxster 981 S PDK, I couldn't feel much difference in performance – but the 997 looked 100x better. I found my match: a very well-maintained 2005 Tiptronic 997.1, which catches the light just right and looks blue in certain conditions. Hence the name: "Bluey," after the world's most beloved Aussie dog.

The pre-purchase inspection was thorough:
- Bore scope verified ✓
- MOT and maintenance history reviewed ✓
- IMS bearing variant checked against engine number ✓

There's always risk with these long road trips. Really, the only car I'd 100% trust to make it there and back is a Toyota Land Cruiser – but it's neither economical nor European, and where's the romance in that?

## The Route (ever changing)

Originally, I planned to take the scenic route through Western Europe to Slovenia, then down the Adriatic coast through Croatia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Albania. Insurance and time constraints had other ideas – I needed to stay within the EU.

A last-minute route change (now via Serbia and Bulgaria) meant I did get to add in a short stop in Dresden to visit old friends.

## The Journey Begins

### Day 1: London to Antwerp
**Countries crossed: UK, France, Belgium**

Woke up early Thursday morning with that pre-trip excitement. Made the 9:36 Le Shuttle to Calais – there's something super cool about driving your car onto a train that goes under the sea. 

The hop from Calais to Antwerp was quick and uneventful, arriving at the hotel by 3 PM. First concern: Bluey was making a funny "clonking" noise from the front suspension. Apparently common with 997s, but not exactly what you want to hear at the start of a 5,000km journey. 

Did a bit of work (always more to do), then took a bus into Antwerp's city center. Found a proper frituur for dinner – because when in Belgium, you eat frites – before jumping into bed early. Tomorrow would be the first real test.

### Day 2: Antwerp to Dresden  
**Countries crossed: Belgium, Netherlands, Germany**

Left Antwerp just after 7 AM, pushing through thick Belgian and Dutch commuter traffic. Nothing quite prepares you for the organized chaos of morning rush hour in the Low Countries.

Another route change on the fly – realized I didn't have the appropriate environmental stickers (Umweltplakette) for Dortmund or Düsseldorf. Headed south instead via Köln, then southeast toward Frankfurt before turning north again on the A4 toward Dresden. 

Multiple fuel stops along the way – the 997 drinks premium unleaded like a proper sports car should. Arrived in Dresden with Bluey running strong, though that suspension clonk persisted. I've since quasi-diagnosed it as one of the common 997 suspension issues that can wait until we're back in the UK. (Famous last words?)

## Impressions

**The Good:**
- The power is immense. You can be cruising at 150km/h, apply a little more throttle, and the car jumps forward like a startled thoroughbred. The flat-six pulls hard.
- The 8-disc CD changer is surprisingly awesome in 2024. Endless music without touching your phone. Also spent time scanning local radio stations, listening to incomprehensible chatter about news, gossip, and politics.
- The sunroof was absolutely the right choice. Windows down, sunroof open – you feel connected to the world. Button everything up, and you're wrapped in a cocoon of German engineering.

**The Reality Check:**
- Road noise really grates after a couple of hours. I'm wearing high-fidelity earplugs that help, but it's still prominent.
