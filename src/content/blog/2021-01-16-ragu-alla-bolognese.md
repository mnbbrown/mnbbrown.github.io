My go-to recipe for spag bol sauce.

## Ingredients

- 500g beef mince (not too lean - fat is tasty)
- 250g pancetta chopped (bacon will also do)
- 85g carrot finely chopped (normally ~1 carrot)
- 85g celery finely chopped
- 85g onion finely chopped (one medium onion)
- 50g tomato paste
- 210ml red or white wine
- 300ml milk

## Method

1. Heat a bit of oil in a large saucepan and add 250g of chopped pancetta. Cook until the pancetta starts to release it's fat.
2. Add all the finely chopped vegetables (85g of carrot, celery and onion). Cook until onion is transparent
3. Add 500g of mince and cook until lightly browned.
4. Add 50g tomato paste and 210ml of red or white wine and mix through.
5. Add 300ml milk and mix through.
6. Cook, covered and stiring occationally, for 2 to 3 hours. The longer the better.

Serve with pasta or store - this is one of those dishes that tastes best a couple of days later.
