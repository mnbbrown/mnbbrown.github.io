        I currently lead engineering at Elyos in London.
      </p>
        <p>
        My passion is leading high performing engineering teams, small or large, that own complex technical systems. I've spent most of my career in regulated industries like healthcare and finance, balancing technical innovation with regulatory rigour.
        </p>
      <p>
        I’m equally comfortable setting strategy, coaching and mentoring teams, and shipping enterprise code in a wide variety of languages, frameworks and cloud providers - across frontend, backend, infrastructure, AI/data platforms and hardware.

      <p>
        At GoCardless I led the product teams responsible for managing our risk and operations across anti-fraud,
        AML, compliance, credit risk and customer support. The role was a blend of architecture and system design, 
        company wide technical leadership of ~150 engineers, critical incident response and hands-on development. 
      </p>
      <p>I led the successful delivery of several high-profile domain and company-wide initiatives, and the cultural turnaround of a number of under performing teams. Key achievements include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Led the teams that built GC's first real-time data platform, enabling scalable transaction monitoring 
            to detect fraud and AML risks across billions of transactions. Reduced fraud losses to &lt;1% of revenue across the UK, EU, US, Australia, and New Zealand through rapid iteration of ML and rule-based fraud detection models.
          </li>
          <li>
            Co-designed and championed a new org-wide technical design standard (the "GC Software Design Framework"). Measurable improvement in company wide reliability, a reduction in critical incidents, without any impact on velocity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Led the multi-million pound technical procurement of new analyst tooling, allowing real-time response to novel risk typologies with minimal engineering support.
