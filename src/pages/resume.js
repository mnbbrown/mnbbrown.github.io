          <p>I am currently a Principal Software Engineer at GoCardless.</p>
          <p>
            My passion is building complex technical systems and growing high performing engineering teams. I've spent
            most of my career at the pointy end of startups and new businesses - mostly in regulated environments such
            as healthcare and (more recently) fintech. I've led large engineering teams and shipped production code
            using a wide variety of languages, frameworks and cloud providers - across frontend, backend,
            infrastructure, data platforms and hardware.
